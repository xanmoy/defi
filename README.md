# Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Smart Contract

## Description

This repository contains the source code for a decentralized exchange (DEX) smart contract implemented in Solidity. The DEX allows users to deposit, withdraw, and swap ERC20 tokens in a trustless manner directly on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **Deposit:** Users can deposit ERC20 tokens into the DEX smart contract.
- **Withdraw:** Users can withdraw ERC20 tokens from the DEX smart contract.
- **Swap:** Users can swap ERC20 tokens with each other directly through the DEX smart contract.
- **Admin Control:** The contract owner/administrator has the authority to transfer admin rights to another address.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/DEX.git`
2. Compile the Solidity contract using a Solidity compiler.
3. Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum network using a compatible wallet or development tool.
4. Interact with the deployed contract using Ethereum wallets or custom scripts.

## Integration with Web and Mobile

This DEX smart contract can be integrated into both web and mobile platforms using the following technologies:

### Website (Web3 Integration)

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Express.js
- **Server:** Node.js

### Mobile App

- **Framework:** React Native
- **Bridge for Native Functionality:** Capacitor.js

## Requirements

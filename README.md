## Introduction

Welcome to CapacitorJS!

CapacitorJS is a cross-platform runtime that allows developers to build web applications using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript) and deploy them as native applications on iOS, Android, and the web. It provides a consistent API for accessing native features such as camera, geolocation, file system, and more, while offering the flexibility to integrate with existing web projects.

## Features

- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Develop once and deploy on multiple platforms including iOS, Android, and the web.
- **Native Access**: Utilize native device features through a unified JavaScript API.
- **Web Technology Stack**: Build applications using familiar web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Modern Development Workflow**: Integrated with modern tooling such as npm, TypeScript, and ES6, enabling efficient development practices.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extend functionality by integrating with a wide range of community-contributed plugins.
